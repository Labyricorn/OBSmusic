  - _Requirements: Improvement Requirement 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Fix terminal error messages
  - Identify source of "video system not initialized" error
  - Implement proper error handling to suppress non-pertinent messages
  - Ensure only relevant information is displayed in terminal
  - _Requirements: Improvement Requirement 3_

- [ ] 3.1 Debug video system initialization error
  - Locate source of "ERROR:core.player_engine:Error in player update: video system not initialized"
