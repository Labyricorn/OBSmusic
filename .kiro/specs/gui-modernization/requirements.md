# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modernizing the existing Python GUI music player interface to provide a more contemporary, compact, and visually appealing user experience. The current GUI uses a dated Tkinter interface that is oversized for its functionality and lacks modern visual design elements. The modernization will reduce the window size by approximately 50% both vertically and horizontally while implementing a modern design aesthetic and improving the music note indicator functionality.

**Update**: This document has been updated to include requirements for dynamic hyperlink URLs and application icon integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a more compact GUI interface, so that it takes up less screen real estate while maintaining full functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI is launched THEN the window SHALL be approximately 400x300 pixels (50% reduction from current 800x600)
2. WHEN the window is resized THEN all components SHALL scale appropriately within the new size constraints
3. WHEN all current functionality is accessed THEN it SHALL work identically to the current implementation
4. WHEN the compact layout is displayed THEN all controls SHALL remain easily clickable and readable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern-looking interface, so that the application feels contemporary and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI is displayed THEN it SHALL use a modern color scheme with contemporary styling
2. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL have modern flat or rounded design elements
3. WHEN the interface is viewed THEN it SHALL use modern typography and spacing principles
4. WHEN hover effects occur THEN they SHALL provide subtle visual feedback
5. WHEN the overall design is assessed THEN it SHALL feel cohesive and professional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the music note indicator to follow the currently playing song, so that I can easily identify which song is active in the playlist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a song is playing THEN the music note indicator SHALL appear next to the currently playing song
2. WHEN the song changes THEN the music note indicator SHALL move to the new current song
3. WHEN no song is playing THEN no music note indicator SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN the playlist is reordered THEN the music note indicator SHALL follow the currently playing song to its new position
5. WHEN playback stops THEN the music note indicator SHALL be removed from all songs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modernized interface to maintain all existing functionality, so that I don't lose any features during the update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any existing button is clicked THEN it SHALL perform the same function as before
2. WHEN playlist operations are performed THEN they SHALL work identically to the current implementation
3. WHEN drag-and-drop reordering is used THEN it SHALL function exactly as before
4. WHEN file management operations are performed THEN they SHALL maintain current behavior
5. WHEN web interface access is needed THEN it SHALL be available through the new hyperlink implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved visual hierarchy and organization, so that the interface is more intuitive and easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN related controls SHALL be visually grouped together
2. WHEN the layout is viewed THEN the most important elements SHALL be prominently displayed
3. WHEN the current song display is shown THEN it SHALL be clearly distinguished from other elements
4. WHEN the playlist is displayed THEN it SHALL have clear visual separation from controls
5. WHEN the interface is used THEN the visual flow SHALL guide users naturally through common tasks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want web interface access through hyperlinked text instead of buttons, so that I can easily copy URLs and have a cleaner interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web interface links are displayed THEN they SHALL appear as clickable hyperlinked text
2. WHEN a web interface link is left-clicked THEN it SHALL open the corresponding web interface in the browser
3. WHEN a web interface link is right-clicked THEN it SHALL show a context menu with copy option
4. WHEN the copy option is selected THEN the URL SHALL be copied to the clipboard
5. WHEN the hyperlinks are displayed THEN they SHALL be visually distinct from regular text but not appear as buttons

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the hyperlinks to point to the correct dynamic ports, so that I can access the web interfaces regardless of which ports the application is using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts with default ports THEN the display hyperlink SHALL point to http://localhost:8080
2. WHEN the application starts with default ports THEN the controls hyperlink SHALL point to http://localhost:8081
3. WHEN the application starts with a custom web port THEN the display hyperlink SHALL point to http://localhost:[custom_port]
4. WHEN the application starts with a custom web port THEN the controls hyperlink SHALL point to http://localhost:[custom_port + 1]
5. WHEN the ports change at runtime THEN the hyperlinks SHALL update to reflect the new ports
6. WHEN the web servers are not running THEN the hyperlinks SHALL still display the correct URLs that would be used

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to use the OBSmusic.ico file as its icon and proper branding, so that it has a consistent brand identity across the GUI and web interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI window is displayed THEN it SHALL use OBSmusic.ico as the window icon
2. WHEN the GUI window is displayed THEN the title bar SHALL read "OBSmusic" instead of "Music Player"
3. WHEN the web display page is loaded THEN it SHALL use OBSmusic.ico as the favicon
4. WHEN the web controls page is loaded THEN it SHALL use OBSmusic.ico as the favicon
5. WHEN the icon file is missing THEN the application SHALL gracefully fall back to default icons without crashing
6. WHEN the icon file is corrupted THEN the application SHALL log the error and use default icons
