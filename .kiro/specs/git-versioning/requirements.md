# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Git version control functionality into the application, allowing users to track changes, manage versions, and collaborate on code or content. The system will provide essential Git operations through a user-friendly interface while maintaining the power and flexibility of Git's underlying capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a Git repository in my project, so that I can start tracking changes to my files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Initialize Repository" THEN the system SHALL create a new Git repository in the current directory
2. WHEN a repository is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a .git directory with proper Git structure
3. IF a Git repository already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and not overwrite existing repository
4. WHEN initialization is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm successful repository creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to stage and commit changes to my files, so that I can save snapshots of my work progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views file status THEN the system SHALL display modified, added, and deleted files
2. WHEN a user stages files THEN the system SHALL add selected files to the staging area
3. WHEN a user commits changes THEN the system SHALL require a commit message
4. WHEN a commit is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique commit hash and store the snapshot
5. IF no files are staged THEN the system SHALL prevent commit creation and display appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view the commit history, so that I can track the evolution of my project and understand what changes were made when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests commit history THEN the system SHALL display commits in reverse chronological order
2. WHEN displaying commits THEN the system SHALL show commit hash, author, date, and message
3. WHEN a user selects a specific commit THEN the system SHALL display the changes made in that commit
4. WHEN viewing commit details THEN the system SHALL show file diffs with additions and deletions highlighted

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and switch between branches, so that I can work on different features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new branch THEN the system SHALL create the branch from the current commit
2. WHEN a user switches branches THEN the system SHALL update the working directory to match the target branch
3. WHEN switching branches with uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL warn the user and require action
4. WHEN listing branches THEN the system SHALL indicate the current active branch
5. IF a branch name already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and display error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to merge branches, so that I can integrate feature work back into the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a merge THEN the system SHALL attempt to automatically merge compatible changes
2. WHEN merge conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicted files and require manual resolution
3. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the system SHALL allow completion of the merge
4. WHEN a merge is successful THEN the system SHALL create a merge commit linking both branch histories
5. IF the target branch is not up to date THEN the system SHALL recommend updating before merging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to remote repositories, so that I can collaborate with others and backup my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a remote repository THEN the system SHALL store the remote URL and name
2. WHEN a user pushes changes THEN the system SHALL upload local commits to the remote repository
3. WHEN a user pulls changes THEN the system SHALL download and integrate remote commits
4. WHEN push/pull operations fail THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
5. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL prompt for credentials securely

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the current status of my repository, so that I can understand what files have changed and what actions are needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user checks repository status THEN the system SHALL display current branch name
2. WHEN displaying status THEN the system SHALL show staged, modified, and untracked files separately
3. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL indicate the type of change (modified, added, deleted)
4. WHEN the repository is clean THEN the system SHALL display "no changes" message
5. IF the repository is ahead/behind remote THEN the system SHALL indicate sync status
